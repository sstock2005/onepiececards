## One Piece Cards
A simple One Piece TCG Card Database written in Rust!

## Purpose
This was written by me to help my brother and I keep track of what One Piece TCG cards we have and how much they are worth.

## How To Use
- Download release.exe
- Hit Enter when it says it can't find the database
- Type 1 and enter to search for a card you own
- Type in your card name, it's better if you do like "{name} {booster pack}/{starter deck}"
- Find your card in the list (check the one piece code)
- If you only have one of them, type "1:{NUMBER}" to add x1 of your desired card!
- Type "3" back in the menu to generate a report!
- Type "y" to open it!
- Done!!

## Where do I get the Data?
Sadly, [tcgplayer.com](https://tcgplayer.com) has closed their API and are not accepting new users, so I had to use the API their website uses!
